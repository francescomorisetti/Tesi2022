Horace README, version 3.2
==========================
Horace is an event generator for Drell-Yan processes at hadron colliders
including the ElectroWeak radiative corrections. The generator is
developed and mantained by C.M. Carloni Calame [1], G. Montagna [1,2],
O. Nicrosini [1] and A. Vicini [3].

Changelog
---------
3.1 -> 3.2:
Version 3.2 was used for the report "Precision Studies of
Observables in pp->W->l\nu and pp->\gamma,Z->l+l- processes at the LHC" by
S. Alioli et al. (http://inspirehep.net/record/1468163).
W.r.t. version 3.1, the generation efficiency is improved and some
small bug have been fixed.
The generator is now interfaced by default to LHAPDF parton
distribution functions and the input file has been cleaned up.
Instructions to reproduce the numbers published in the report are
given at the end of this file.
Other changes:

1) in the previous version, it was assumed that for the parton
densities s=s_bar, c=c_bar, b=b_bar. Now the densities from PDFs are
taken without any assumption.

2) A new parameter in input has been introduced to choose the PDF
renormalization/factorization scale (see below).

3) Three possible choices are now available for EW input scheme for
neutral current Drell-Yan (for charged current ony 0 and 1 are active):
  0 - alpha(0) scheme,
  1 - G_mu scheme,
  2 - IBA, which includes vacuum polarization in the photon exchange
      diagrams, and some universal higher order corrections.

4) The libraries LoopTools and Cuba are updated to the latest
version (2.13 and 4.2 respectively), which should work better with
modern compilers and on more platforms.
Both libraries have been patched to work within Horace as expected.


3.0 -> 3.1:
3.1 is essentially a bug fix release. Some of the bugs
pointed out by Horace users have been fixed. In particular,
1) the bad behaviour of one-loop radiative corrections at very
   low invariant masses in W production (< 2-3 GeV) has been
   corrected
2) the crashes appearing when running without cuts and
   occurring in the limits of the phase space have been resolved
   Furthermore, in release 3.1, also tau final state can be
   selected and the name of the statistics file saved in the
   output directory is determined by the run parameters and has
   the .stat extension.

Compiling the code
------------------------------
Horace is written in standard FORTRAN.

A Makefile is provided in order to build the executable file 'horace'.

Prior to compilation, the user must set the LHAPDFLIB and REPORT
variables in the Makefile and set the compilers in compilers.in.

The code has been tested to work with GCC (version >= 4.7.2).

The Horace package includes a copy of the libraries LoopTools
(http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/, v. 2.13, patched to cover
the complex W and Z mass in vertex and box functions as required by
the Horace approach), Cuba (http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/, v. 4.2,
for the calculation of the subtraction terms) and includes the file hadr5n16.f by F.
Jegerlehner (http://www-com.physik.hu-berlin.de/~fjeger/) for the calculation of
the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarization.

Running Horace
--------------
If the LHAPDF libraries are dinamically linked, please make sure the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is properly set before running HORACE.

The value of the input parameters which have to be provided to the program
can be conveniently specified in the file input-test.

**NB**
Any generation cut must be implemented in the file cuts.f. The file
should be self-explaining.
******

If the option unweighted is chosen, the program will generate the requested 
number of unweighted events (given the unweightening efficiency, a larger number
of points will be generated in the phase-space).
If the option weighted is chosen, the program will generate the specified
number of points and compute the cross-section and the distributions.

The rescaling factor to adjust the efficiency of the unweightening procedure
changes the maximum value in the "hit or miss" procedure:
if too large the efficiency decreases, if too small a certain number of points
could exceed the maximum value and can not be correctly unweighted, introducing
a bias in the estimate of the hit or miss cross section.
In the output file '*.stat' a recommended value for this parameter 
is suggested 'a posteriori' and the bias induced by the points which exceed the 
maximum is evaluated. The rescaling factor must be chosen large enough to
make the bias vanish. Nevertheless, a smaller value can increase the efficiency
while keeping the bias at a tolerable level.

For a given hadronic center-of-mass energy, for a given choice of the PDF and
the PDF factorization scale, the program allows to compute only once the
subtraction terms which remove the initial state collinear singularities.
When the variable which specifies the subtraction mode is set to 'calculate'
the subtraction terms are computed and saved in the file 'subtractionfile.dat' 
(which can be set in input). The next time, the program can be run with the 
subtraction mode 'read', and the grid which interpolates the subtraction terms
is read from the file 'subtractionfile.dat'.

We provide also a routine to apply selection cuts to the event sample. By
default, we impose cuts on the lepton and neutrino (or leptons) pt and 
lepton(s) pseudorapidity.
The user can implement his/her own cuts by modifying the file cuts.f.

The events produced by HORACE can be dumped to an external file
(test_run/*.evts) and can be given as input to standard showering
Monte Carlo generators using the Les Houches Interface Accord.

User modifiable routines
------------------------
The subroutines the user may need to modify are:
-> 'userinterface' (in the file init.f) where the masses and widths of the 
    elementary particles, the values of the coupling constants and of
    the CKM matrix are defined

-> 'initPDFhorace' (in the file PDF.f) where it is possible to choose
   the available PDF sets. From version 3.2 we only provide an
   interface to LHAPDF. 

-> 'cuts' (in the file cuts.f) where the experimental are implememted

-> 'initrng' and 'wraprng' (in the file routines.f), initialization
   and wrapper for the random number generator.

Output files
------------
The output files are saved in the 'test_run/' directory (which can be set
by the user). 
   The files are

-> *.stat: it is the file where cross
   sections, statistics information, input parameters, etc. are printed.
   After the input parameters entered by the user, the weighted integrated
   cross section is printed.
   It is subdivided by photon multiplicity: each cross section
   depends on the 'eps' parameter but the sum does not.
   After weighted cross section information, the unweighted events statistics
   is reported. The user must pay attention to the "biases" cross sections:
   they account for the biases due to negative weights events and unweightening
   failure due to an under-estimated maximum of the differential cross section.
   The latter bias  is usually negligible, its size is estimated by the
   corresponding cross section.

-> distribution files: in these files some differential distribution
   are written. The file names should be self-explaining and the data are in the
   form (e.g. to be easily plotted with gnuplot):
   lower bin edge - differential cross section - corresponding error

   By default, the following distributions are saved:
    - lepton transverse momentum distribution, in different ranges
      (ptl1, ptl2, ptl3)
    - missing (or lepton) transverse momentum distribution, in different ranges
      (ptn1, ptn2, ptn3)
    - W or Z/gamma transverse mass distribution, in different ranges
      (mtv1, mtv2, mtv3)
    - lepton pseudorapidity distribution (etal)
    - neutrino (or lepton) pseudorapidity distribution (etan)
    - W or Z/gamma rapidity distribution (yv)
    - W or Z/gamma transverse momentum distribution (ptv)
    - most energetic photon transverse momentum distribution (ptg)
    - most energetic photon rapidity distribution (etag)
    - W  or Z/gamma invariant mass distribution in different ranges (minv, mhi)

Les-Houches-Accord-format event dumping
---------------------------------------
If the option of saving events is set to 'y', a file .evts and a file .conf are
saved in the output directory. The events are stored in a LHA compliant format
(mainly stolen from ALPGEN). The events are dumped by the routine
'storehoraceevent' (in the file storage.f). The weight corresponding to the events
is +1 or -1 in case of unweighted generation or the event cross section in
case of weighted generation (which can be also negative).

How to reproduce the report numbers
-----------------------------------
- Set in the Makefile the "REPORT=-DREPORT" variable, which selects the
  correct cuts and input parameters according to the tuned or benchmark
  setup;

- make sure the variable "LHAPDFLIB" in the Makefile points to the
  installation of LHAPDF **version 5.9.1** (any other version might
  give slightly different results). Make sure you have MSTW2008nlo68cl
  PDF set installed;

- compile horace ("make horace");

- as examples, a set of input files (input-report-*) is provided to
  reproduce NLO results from tables 3, 7, 9 and 11 of the report,
  which should be fed as input to horace;

- run the program issuing the command

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=PATH_TO_YOUR_LHAPDFLIB_DIR ./horace < INPUTFILE


   Enjoy Horace!
